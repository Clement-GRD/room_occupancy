# Room Occupancy Project

This is a simple project aiming at estimating the occupancy (count) of a room using data recorded by different sensors (temperature, CO2, sound, light and motion) as a function of time.

Data are based on a [paper published in IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8644432) and can be found on [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/864/room+occupancy+estimation).

This project also serves as a test to start using Git and GitHub.

## Structure
- `room_occupancy.ipynb` is the main notebook for the project.
- `room_occupancy_module.py` contains functions used in the main notebook.
- `transformers.py` contains scikit-learn transformers used in the main notebook.
