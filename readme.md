# ROOM OCCUPANCY PROJECT

This is a simple project aiming at estimating the occupancy (count) of a room using data recorded by different sensors (temperature, CO2, sound, light and motion) as a function of time.

Data are based on a [paper published in IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8644432) and can be found on [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/864/room+occupancy+estimation).

This project also serves as a test to start using Git and GitHub.
